= Camel Quarkus - Rest/Soap Demo

Explore, build, test and deploy a Camel Quarkus demo application using the Developer Sandbox and OpenShift Dev Spaces.

This hands-on lab is based on the following blog article in Red Hat Developers:

* link:{article-url}[window="_blank", , id="rhd-source-article"]

{empty} +

Assuming you have followed the article's instructions, you should be all set to get hands-on with _Camel Quarkus_ in the _OpenShift Dev Spaces_ workspace.

For illustration purposes, the picture below shows what the integration end-to-end flow looks like.

image::images/00-demo-end2end.png[align="center", width=80%]

A client invokes an OpenApi service. A _Camel_ route attends the call, translates the JSON input into SOAP and calls a backend service to obtain a SOAP response, then it's translated back to JSON before responding to the original service call.

Take aways for this lab:

* Try out an _OpenShift_ environment.
* Work in a full browser based IDE environment.
* Build, deploy and test a _Camel Quarkus_ application.
* Adopt contract-first approach for both REST and SOAP.
* Define direct JSON â‡„ SOAP transformations using XSLTs.
* Discover and test REST operations using Swagger UI.
* Learn how to implement both SOAP client/server sides.

[id="explore-code"]
== Explore the source code

The _Camel_ source file `api-simple.yaml` defines the entire end-to-end processing logic, which you can find in your project explorer under the path:

--
* `camelq/level1simple-soap/src/main/resources/routes/api-simple.yaml`
+
image::images/00-camel-routes.png[align="left", width=30%]
+
{blank}
+
Click on the Camel source file to display it in your code editor.
--

{empty} +

Inside the Camel source you'll see the main route definition:

image::images/00-camel-main.png[align="left", width=50%]

{blank}

The key processing actions are:

. Performs the JSON to SOAP transformation.
. Invokes the SOAP backend service.
. Transforms the SOAP response into JSON.

{blank}

The code above is written using the YAML DSL (_Domain Specific Language_), but _Camel_ also provides a Java DSL and an XML DSL.

Feel free to explore other regions of the code and project if you are curious about the entire implementation. 

Interesting areas of the code you can look at are:

* OpenApi definition in the `openapi.json` resource.
** Used in a `Maven` plugin to auto-generate Camel's REST DSL.
+
{blank}
+
* WSDL definition to declare the SOAP service.
** Used by Quarkus to auto-generate the SOAP Java classes.
+
{blank}
+
* CXF endpoint definition in the `Routes.java` source file.
** Uses the auto-generated SOAP Java classes.
+
{blank}
+
* 2-way JSON/SOAP transformations using XSLT definitions.
** Uses XSLT's out-of-the-box json/xml xpath converters.
+
{blank}
+
* Junit to test/validate the implementation.
** Spins up a SOAP backend service.
** Validates the REST request/response
** Validates the SOAP request sent to the backend.

[id="terminal-stub"]
== Run the stub in your terminal

The stub acts as the SOAP backend service that provides the SOAP data we need to fetch.

{empty} +

. Open your terminal
+
Make sure you make your terminal visible in the IDE. You can toggle it using the keyboard keys kbd:[Ctrl + `] or simply find the option from the menu system as per the picture below:
+
image::images/01-toggle-terminal.png[align="left", width=40%]

. Let's first run the stub
+
Copy and paste the following command in your terminal to place yourself in the stub's Camel Quarkus project:
+
[source, subs=]
----
cd camelq/stubs/soap1<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
Then, copy/paste the following command to start the stub in the terminal:
+
[source, subs=]
----
./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev -Ddebug=6006<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* After _Maven_ downloads all the dependencies, you should see in your terminal logs that the stub has started:
+
image::images/02-stub-terminal-logs.png[align="left", width=100%]
+
NOTE: Two notifications will pop up to inform you of new listening ports. You can ignore these messages; they will automatically close after a few seconds.
--
+
{empty} +
+
Now, test your stub from a new terminal. From your terminal's top right corner, choose the Split option, as shown below:
+
image::images/03-terminal-split.png[align="left", width=40%]
+
{blank}
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-d @src/main/resources/request.xml \
http://localhost:9000/services/s1 \
| xmllint --format - \
| bat -pP -lxml<br>
----
+
NOTE: The command also includes pipes to pretty-print and colorize the SOAP output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return a SOAP payload similar to:
+
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <ns2:SubscriberResponse xmlns:ns2="http://www.example.org/s1/">
      <Name>Some</Name>
      <Surname>One</Surname>
      <Address>
        <Number>1</Number>
        <Street>Some Street</Street>
        <City>Somewhere</City>
        <PostCode>SOME C0D3</PostCode>
        <Country>UK</Country>
      </Address>
    </ns2:SubscriberResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
----

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same SOAP message as shown above?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully tested the stub !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in the stub logs to investigate the possible causes of failure.



[time=2]
[id="terminal-service"]
== Run the service in your terminal

The main _Camel_ service exposes a JSON REST API and integrates with the SOAP backend service (the stub).

{empty} +

. Run the main service
+
Copy and paste the following command in your terminal to place yourself in the main Camel Quarkus project:
+
[source, subs=]
----
cd /projects/devsandbox-camel/camelq/level1simple-soap/<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
Then, copy/paste the following command to start the REST service in the terminal:
+
[source, subs=]
----
./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* Some more dependencies will be downloaded before the engine starts. When done, you should see logs of both systems in both terminals:
+
image::images/04-terminal-system-logs.png[align="left", width=100%]
+
NOTE: More notifications pop up about the new listening ports. You can ignore these messages; they will automatically close after a few seconds.
--

+
{blank}
+
Open a third terminal from which you can issue commands. From your terminal's top right corner, choose the Split option as shown below:
+
image::images/05-terminal-split-2.png[align="left", width=40%]
+
{blank}
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":"123"}' \
http://localhost:8080/camel/subscriber/details | jq<br>
----
+
NOTE: The command includes a pipe to parse the JSON response with JQuery, which nicely renders the returned JSON payload.
+
{blank}
+
The cURL command should return a JSON payload similar to:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----

{empty} +


[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same JSON response as the one shown above?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully tested the main service !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in the stub logs to investigate possible causes of failure.



[time=3]
[id="deploy-stub"]
== Deploy and test the stub

The stub acts as the SOAP backend service that provides the SOAP data we need to fetch.

{empty} +

. Stop both systems
+
Make sure you stop both the stub and the main service by selecting each terminal and pressing the keys kbd:[Ctrl + c]. Your view of your terminals should look like:
+
image::images/06-terminal-systems-stopped.png[align="left", width=100%]
+
{empty} +
+
. Deploy the stub
+
Make sure your CLI `oc` client (_OpenShift_ client) points to your _Developer Sandbox_ project (aka namespace):
+
[source, subs=]
----
oc projects -q | grep dev | xargs oc project<br>
----
+
NOTE: The _Developer Sandbox_ only allows 1 project (namespace) per user.
+
The command above should output something similar to:
+
----
Now using project "<your-username>-dev" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".
----
+
{blank}
+
WARNING: Not specifying your target project (namespace) in _OpenShift_ may result in a deployment failure.
+
{empty} +
+
You can now copy and paste the following command in your terminal to trigger the deployment:
+
[source, subs=]
----
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* You'll see Maven fetching more dependencies and then interact with OpenShift to finalise the deployment of the stub.
+
When done, if successful, going back to your browser's tab with your _OpenShift's_ developer topology view, you should see the new service up and ready when fully started, looking similar to:
+
image::images/07-topology-stub.png[align="left", width=15%]
--
+
{empty} +
+
. Test the stub
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-d @src/main/resources/request.xml \
http://soap1:8080/services/s1 \
| xmllint --format - \
| bat -pP -lxml<br>
----
+
NOTE: The cURL command above now points to the newly deployed pod, with its service `soap1` listening on port `8080`.
+
NOTE: The command also includes pipes to pretty-print and colorize the SOAP output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return a SOAP payload similar to:
+
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <ns2:SubscriberResponse xmlns:ns2="http://www.example.org/s1/">
      <Name>Some</Name>
      <Surname>One</Surname>
      <Address>
        <Number>1</Number>
        <Street>Some Street</Street>
        <City>Somewhere</City>
        <PostCode>SOME C0D3</PostCode>
        <Country>UK</Country>
      </Address>
    </ns2:SubscriberResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
----

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same SOAP message as shown above?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully tested the stub deployed in the sandbox !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in the stub logs to investigate possible causes of failure.


[time=4]
[id="deploy-service"]
== Deploy and test the main service

With the stub already deployed, we just need to deploy the service which will integrate with the stub running under the same namespace.

{empty} +

. Deploy the service
+
Ensure you run the commands below from the terminal located in the path of your main service project.
+
You can now copy and paste the following command in your terminal to trigger the deployment:
+
[source, subs=]
----
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* Maven will interact with OpenShift to deploy the service.
+
When done, if successful, going back to your browser's tab with your _OpenShift's_ developer topology view, you should see both services available, the main service and the stub, up and ready when fully started, looking similar to:
+
image::images/08-topology-service-stub.png[align="left", width=30%]
--
+
{empty} +
+
. Test the service
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the `simple` service:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":"123"}' \
http://simple:8080/camel/subscriber/details | jq<br>
----
+
NOTE: The cURL command above now points to the newly deployed pod's _Kubernetes_ service `simple`, listening on port `8080`.
+
NOTE: The command also includes a pipe to parse and colorise the JSON output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return a JSON payload similar to:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----
+
{empty} +
+
. Invoke the service as an external client
+
Notice the previous cURL command uses an internal service URL, which is not directly accessible by external consumers. However, the deployment automatically creates a route in OpenShift that exposes the service to external clients.
+
You can obtain the route details with the following command and use its URL from your favourite local HTTP client/tester, like _Postman_, _Swagger_ or others.
+
[source, subs=]
----
oc get route simple<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
Embedding `oc get route` into commands allows you to discover and invoke the service as an external consumer.
+
--
* For example, copy/paste the following cURL command to simulate an external call and obtain a response from the _Camel_ service:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":"123"}' \
http://`oc get route simple -o jsonpath={.spec.host}`/camel/subscriber/details | jq<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return a JSON payload similar to:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----
+
{blank}
+
* You can also use the server's Swagger UI from your browser to trigger an external call from your computer. Copy/paste the following command to obtain Swagger's URL: 
+
[source, subs=]
----
echo http://`oc get route simple -o jsonpath={.spec.host}`/q/camel/openapi.json<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
Then, click on the URL generated and follow the link as per the image below:
+
image::images/09-swagger-url-follow-link.png[align="left", width=50%]
+
{blank}
+
Following the actions above should open the following view:
+
image::images/10-swagger-ui.png[align="left", width=50%]
+
{blank}
+
====
. Click on the `POST` operation.
. Click on `Try it out`
. Click on the blue button `Execute`
====
+
{blank}
+
You should see again the following response:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----
+
{blank}
+
--

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same JSON response as shown above?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully invoked the simple service as an external client !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in the stub logs to investigate possible causes of failure.

{empty} +


[time=1]
[id="clean-up"]
== Clean up your namespace

When you're done playing in the _Developer Sandbox_, you can clean up your Sandbox namespace by un-deploying your Camel `simple` service and stub `soap1` using the following commands:

[source, subs=]
----
oc get all -o name | grep simple | xargs oc delete<br>
----

[source, subs=]
----
oc get all -o name | grep soap1 | xargs oc delete<br>
----

{blank}

Executing the commands above should leave your topology view clean from routes, services, and other Kubernetes artifacts in your namespace.

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Is your namespace clean from artifacts?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully cleaned up your namespace !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in the stub logs to investigate possible causes of failure.

{empty} +
